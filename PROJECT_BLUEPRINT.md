- **Specialist:** Developer (guided by `core/pmo-1-sre`)
- **Status:** **IN_PROGRESS**

## 10. Current Task Brief
- **Task ID:** P4-T2
- **Assigned To:** Developer
- **Status:** **COMPLETE**
- **Objective:** Complete the full RAG loop by implementing the "Retrieval" logic. The `KnowledgeRepository` has been updated with a vector search method, and the `ResponseHandler` now uses this to fetch context before calling the LLM.

- **Task ID:** P4-T3
- **Assigned To:** Developer
- **Status:** **PENDING**
- **Objective:** Create the canonical project `README.md` to document the architecture and operational procedures up to this point.

- **Task ID:** P4-T4
- **Assigned To:** Developer
- **Status:** **BLOCKED** (Depends on P4-T3)
- **Objective:** Perform an initial "smoke test" deployment of the application to the target OCI VM to validate the environment and connectivity.
